# To Do List
- figure out a way to sequentially show group members red player's actions without abusing rounds
  - maybe move this part to a separate app to reduce number of skipped pages
  - move from 3 player game to two player game
- update survey
  - remove birthplace question
  - allow more genders and prefer not to tell
  - fix bug on no input on major + ticked non-student, yet error in from
- rework instructions for the Netherlands
- check mobile compatibility, especially of payoff table
- think about timeouts
- move to matching by arrival time to be independent of number of people in the room.
  - this would also automatically handle uneven participant numbers
